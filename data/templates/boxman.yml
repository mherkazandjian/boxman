# The top level boxman application configuration file, typically the default location
# of this file is in ~/.config/boxman/boxman.yml

# The default runtime environment for executing provider commands.
# Can be overridden on the CLI with: boxman --runtime <value> <subcommand>
# Supported values:
#   local          - execute provider commands directly on the host (default)
#   docker-compose - execute inside the boxman docker-compose container
runtime: local

# Runtime-specific settings (used when runtime != local)
runtime_config:
  # Docker container name used by 'docker exec' (docker-compose runtime)
  runtime_container: boxman-libvirt-default
  # Optional: explicit path to docker-compose.yml. When omitted, boxman
  # uses the bundled compose file shipped with the package.
